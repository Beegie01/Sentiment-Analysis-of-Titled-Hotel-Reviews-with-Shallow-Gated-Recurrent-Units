# Sentiment-Analysis-of-Titled-Hotel-Reviews-with-Shallow-Gated-Recurrent-Units

### PROJECT CONCEPT
This is a research project with the aim of providing a relatively simple, computationally inexpensive approach to sentiment analysis of hotel reviews. To achieve this goal, a well-optimised single hidden-layer GRU was proposed and its performance was compared to that of a simple vector machine (SVM) model.<br><br>

### DATASET
Hotel review data used in this research was collected from Opin Rank datasets (Ganesan and Zhai, 2012) comprising titled comments from guests about hotels in many cities worldwide. Only customer reviews of London hotels were used in this study. Due to the absence of sentiment labels, a human annotator was tasked with assigning sentiment labels (-1 for negative reviews and 1 for positive reviews) to the reviews/documents by the emotional meaning of the keywords present in each document. Keywords were determined by selecting only matching words between each documentâ€™s topic and its body of text.<br>
