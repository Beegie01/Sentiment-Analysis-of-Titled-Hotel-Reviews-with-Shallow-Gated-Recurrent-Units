# Sentiment-Analysis-of-Titled-Hotel-Reviews-with-Shallow-Gated-Recurrent-Units

### PROJECT CONCEPT
This is a research project with the aim of providing a relatively simple, computationally inexpensive approach to sentiment analysis of hotel reviews.<br>
To achieve this goal, a well-optimised single hidden-layer GRU was proposed and its performance was compared to that of a simple vector machine (SVM) model.<br>
