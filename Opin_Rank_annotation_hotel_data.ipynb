       "\"We have been to this hotel twice mainly for it's great location to covent garden and the Royal Opera House. Generally the rooms have been fine however on our last visit my wife was half way through showering and the water went completly off. After phoning down to reception we were quickly moved to another room on a lower floor (hoping this may increase the water pressure). However after the shower being on for 30sec it again went off completely. Rather irrate at this point as we had dinner reservations (which we were late for and had to rush our meal) and the fact that my wife had been unsuccessfully trying to shower for 45 minutes I was told by reception that this was common in most hotels when large numbers of guests were trying to shower and to wait for 10 minutes and try again. We travel widely and this is the first time I have ever been in a hotel with any star rating (let alone a London 4/5 star hotel) where it has been physically impossible to take a shower for over 50 minutes. The staff weren't to blame as they responded quickly to all our requests but the managment need to sort out this unacceptable issue.\""

Continental breakfast is the same as you find at most Europe hotels and is included in the price. Yes the lift doesn't work so when we went back to stay for the 2nd time we only booked again if they would give us a 1st Floor room - no higher floor than that, and that was what we got. (1st trip we got the 3rd floor room and I wouldn't go back if I had to walk all that winding stairway again ) The location is right across the road from Paddington station and walking to Hyde Park &amp; beyond was easy. Hop on hop off bus stops at their front door. So if you only want somewhere to sleep at night it's good value, but if you want to spend time in the room during the day, maybe look elsewhere.\""
