For better customer relationships, businesses need to efficiently interpret customer feedbacks.These feedbacks often come in the form of text. 
Therefore, businesses need a way to quickly analyze large volumes of text data.
To address this, I shall implement and compare several architectures of machine learning algorithms.
These models shall identify one of two sentiments in each text.

Many steps are involved in developing a machine learning algorithm to identify sentiment from text data.
Including:
Tokenization, 
Removal of stop words,
Creation of word vectors,
Building and training the model, 
Evaluation of model performance.
Model deployment.
